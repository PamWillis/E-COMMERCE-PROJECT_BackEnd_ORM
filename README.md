# Description
    - Project was created to explore the workings of the back end functions in order to create an E-commerce set up.
    - Built to support the functionality of (ORM). Use of the relationships in order to route the information to and from the database.
    - The relationships solve the problem of when things are linked together items can be added and removed without damaging the whole heirarchy system. For example a product can be removed without removing tags that may also belong to another project. A Category can be removed with all their associated products.
    - I learned how to create models using sequalizer and how to create the routes that will get, pull, update and delete items from the database.
